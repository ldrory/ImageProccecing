When we change the images filter size,
the conv will make a lowpass filter on each level of the pyramid
more size of the filter -> more lowpass filter (blurrs more)

For smaller filter the convolution we will lose less information (of high freq),
so the image will have more sharp details.

as we increase the filter most of the frequencies are in the first layer of the pyramids.
