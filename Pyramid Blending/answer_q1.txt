In each of the pyramid levels we see different frequncies so if we will 
multiply each level by coeff value we will give a different wiegth 
to every part of frequencies and we will get a filter effect.
and the higher of coeff the more of that freq we'll see

pyr[0] ->...->pry[n]
higher freq -> low freq
