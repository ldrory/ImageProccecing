This exercise deals with image pyramids, low-pass and band-pass filtering, and their application in image
blending. In this exercise you will construct Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, use these to implement
pyramid blending, and finally compare the blending results when using different filters in the various
expand and reduce operations.
